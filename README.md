Spritz can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/Spritz/releases).

Spritz uses snakemake and Docker to install and run commandline tools for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. These tools include an [adapted version of SnpEff](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/SnpEff) to annotate sequence variations and create an annotated protein database in XML format. The combinatorics of producing full-length proteoforms from these annotations is written in [mzLib's VariantApplication class](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/mzLib/blob/master/Proteomics/Protein/VariantApplication.cs).

## Running Spritz with GUI

1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).

2. Allocate resources to Docker. There are two ways to do this, described in the Spritz wiki:
    1. The [recommended method](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/Spritz/wiki/Allocating-resources-to-Docker-using-WSL2-(recommended-method)) requires Windows 10 version 2004 and is more robust. Here, we allocate computer resources to Docker like any other program.
    2. The [alternate method](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/Spritz/wiki/Allocating-resources-to-Docker-using-Vmmem-(alternate-method)) is available on all Windows versions but is less robust. Here, we allocate computer resources to Docker using a virtual machine that's packaged with Docker.

3. Launch Spritz.

    Step 1: Input SRA accessions and/or add FASTQ files.
    * SRAs are added with the button indicating single-end or paired-end.
    * FASTQ files must end with *_1.fastq if single-end, and paired-end sequences must have the same filename other than ending with *_1.fastq and *_2.fastq.

    Step 2: Create and customize your Spritz workflow.

    Step 3: Run Spritz!

## GUI System Requirements

* Environment:
  * Windows 10 recommended
  * [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.3-windows-x64-installer)
* 24 GB RAM recommended
* The installer ([Spritz.msi](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/Spritz/releases)) only works on Windows.

## Running Spritz with commandline

Spritz will also [work on the commandline](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/Spritz/wiki/Spritz-commandline-usage) within a Unix system (Linux, Mac, WSL on Windows).

## Test it out! Try constructing the database for U2OS from the paper.

1. Add SRR629563 to the SRA list.

2. Create the Spritz workflow. Select "release-97" and "homo_sapiens."

3. Run Spritz!

Monitor progress in the Information textbox. The final database named `final/combined.spritz.snpeff.protein.withmods.xml.gz` can be used to search MS/MS with [MetaMorpheus](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus) to find variant peptides and proteoforms, possibly with modifications. We recommend performing 1) Calibration, 2) Global PTM Discovery (G-PTM-D), and 3) Search tasks to get the best results.

The final database named `final/combined.spritz.snpeff.protein.fasta` is generated to contain variant protein sequences, and it may be used in other search software, such as Proteome Discoverer, ProSight, and MASH Explorer.

The final database named `final/combined.spritz.snpeff.protein.withdecoys.fasta` is ready for use in MSFragger. It is generated to contain variant protein sequences with decoy protein sequences appended.
